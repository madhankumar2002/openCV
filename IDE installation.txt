To learn openCV, we need an IDE to program. I use pyCharm .
link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

download pycharm from this link and create new project in the name openCV. Further create .py files under the projects for every chapter in the name of chapter_xx.py

In case of playing with images, videos make sure to add your resources in the pycharm folder by just copy pasting.

Head on to chapter-01, learn the code ,make use of comments and try yourself. 

Happy Learning :)
